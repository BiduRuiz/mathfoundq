I'm an undergraduate student at the Physics Institute of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IFUSP). In my Scientific Initiation project I study Quantum Information and General Probabilistic Theories while my research explores the colored graph approach to non-contextual inequalities. I have also enthusiasm about the intersections between Relativity and Quantum Theory.
