Bachelor in Physics by Universidade de São Paulo (São Paulo, Brazil) and Master in Science by 
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Belo Horizonte, Brazil). I have some background 
— Initiation to Science and Masters — in Experimental Quantum Optics, and I am now 
a PhD student on theoretical physics at Universidade Estadual de Campinas. Currently, 
I am on an internship at Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (Vienna, Austria).
My main interest is Foundations of Quantum Theory, in special, classical limits, contextuality and 
informational principles in the Generalized Prababilistic Theories framework.
