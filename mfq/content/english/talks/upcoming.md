## Random Access Code Zoo
### March 25, 2020

Random Access Code (RAC) is a protocol in which some information is encoded into a system by sender and the receiver attempts to decode part of it. It so happens that quantum systems have an advantage over the classical in the terms of probability to decode the information correctly. In this talk I will present a whole zoo of different RAC variants. They have very different properties and applications ranging from practical information processing problems like quantum key distribution to foundations of physics to pure mathematics. I'll discuss these applications.
