## Post-quantum non-classicality: the fun in dreaming
### April 15, 2020

Because "quantum" was not complex enough, in this talk I will introduce you to "post-quantum". We will discuss how current non-classical phenomena, such as those observed in Bell and Steering scenarios, have room to accommodate possible physical theories we have yet to grasp. I will also introduce you to mathematical frameworks to explore toy physical theories (which may supersede quantum) and manifestations of post-quantum phenomena. The aim is to provide you with sufficient context so you can pursue your desired journey into quantum foundations.
