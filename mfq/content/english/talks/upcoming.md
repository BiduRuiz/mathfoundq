## Quantifying Nonlocality and Entanglement relative to Local Operations and Shared Randomness
### Jul 15, 2021

In order to develop a resource theory of nonlocality one must first isolate that essential physical property which underlies Bell inequality violation. We propose nonclassicality of a causal common cause as that property, which implies local operations and shared randomness (LOSR) as the choice of free operations. In this talk I'll explore a myriad after happy conceptual clarifications that follow from electing to quantify nonlocality via LOSR. Highlights include the resolution of anomalies between nonlocality and entanglement, a linear program formulation for assessing convertibility between nonsignalling boxes, conceptual cleanup regarding self-testing, and a causally-motivated definition of multipartiteness relative to LOSR. The latter connects this work to foundational quantum (and GPT) causal inference problems in the notorious triangle scenario.

Based primarily on the recently updated [Understanding the interplay of entanglement and nonlocality: motivating and developing a new branch of entanglement theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09194), as well as the new [No Bipartite-Nonlocal Causal Theory Can Explain Nature's Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09381), and [Quantifying Bell: the Resource Theory of Nonclassicality of Common-Cause Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06311).
