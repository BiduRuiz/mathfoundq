## Entanglement in quantum communications
### Fev 24, 2022

The combination of entanglement and quantum communication is the most general communication resource enabled by quantum theory. Its power is well known due to the fame of quantum dense coding. Surprisingly, 30 years later, beyond the information-theoretic task of encoding and decoding messages (quantum channel capacities), almost nothing is known about the general predictions of quantum theory in these scenarios. In this talk, I give an overview of our recent ground-up investigations of correlations in entanglement-assisted prepare-and-measure scenarios, and also discuss some of the open problems that lay ahead.
