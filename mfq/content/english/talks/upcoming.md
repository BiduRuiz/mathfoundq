## Quantum incompatibility
### Apr 07, 2022

Quantum incompatibility is a fundamental trait of quantum theory. It can be traced back to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, but is nowadays understood as a more general feature with diverse manifestations. It is related to many important quantum phenomena, such as steering, non-locality and contextuality. In this talk, I explain how three basic facts of quantum theory---the no-cloning theorem, no-information-without-disturbance theorem, and the existence of complementary observables---naturally lead to a unified general concept of incompatibility of quantum devices. I present some examples of compatible and incompatible collections of devices, and discuss the most essential properties of the (in)compatibility relation.
