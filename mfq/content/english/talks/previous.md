## Random Access Code Zoo
### March 25, 2020

Random Access Code (RAC) is a protocol in which some information is encoded into a system by sender and the receiver attempts to decode part of it. It so happens that quantum systems have an advantage over the classical in the terms of probability to decode the information correctly. In this talk I will present a whole zoo of different RAC variants. They have very different properties and applications ranging from practical information processing problems like quantum key distribution to foundations of physics to pure mathematics. I'll discuss these applications.

## Law without law: from observer states to physics via algorithmic information theory
### February 25, 2020

Physics and its philosophy are full of puzzles related to the
first-person perspective of observers: Wigner's friend, the Boltzmann
brain problem, Parfit's teletransportation paradox and many others. In
my talk, I argue that there are basically only two options: first,
deliberately declare those problems as outside the scope of science.
Second, explore an alternative approach to the foundations of physics in
which not an "external world", but a mathematical notion of "mind" is
primary. I show how such an approach can be rigorously formulated, how
it reproduces our usual picture of the world to excellent approximation,
and how it can solve the aforementioned problems and more in one stroke.
