## Entanglement in quantum communications
### Fev 24, 2022

The combination of entanglement and quantum communication is the most general communication resource enabled by quantum theory. Its power is well known due to the fame of quantum dense coding. Surprisingly, 30 years later, beyond the information-theoretic task of encoding and decoding messages (quantum channel capacities), almost nothing is known about the general predictions of quantum theory in these scenarios. In this talk, I give an overview of our recent ground-up investigations of correlations in entanglement-assisted prepare-and-measure scenarios, and also discuss some of the open problems that lay ahead.

## Agreement between observers: a physical principle?
### Nov 11, 2021

Is the world quantum? An active research line in quantum foundations is devoted to exploring what constraints can rule out the post-quantum theories that are consistent with experimentally observed results. We explore this question in the context of epistemics, and ask whether agreement between observers can serve as a physical principle that must hold for any theory of the world. Aumann's seminal Agreement Theorem states that two observers (of classical systems) cannot agree to disagree. We propose an extension of this theorem to no-signaling settings. In particular, we establish an Agreement Theorem for observers of quantum systems, while we construct examples of (post-quantum) no-signaling boxes where observers can agree to disagree. The PR box is an extremal instance of this phenomenon. These results make it plausible that agreement between observers might be a physical principle, while they also establish links between the fields of epistemics and quantum information that seem worthy of further exploration.

## Contextuality without incompatibility
### Nov 4, 2021

One of the key studies within quantum theory is to understand exactly how the quantum and classical worlds differ from one another. In this talk I will focus on the notion of generalised noncontextuality, which cleanly delineates between those theories which can be thought of as  admitting of a classical explanation, and those, such as quantum theory, that cannot. In recent work we have shown how this notion can be understood within the framework of generalised  probabilistic theories, which leads to an intuitive, geometric, account of generalised noncontextuality. By doing so we can prove a collection of surprising results, not least of all, that it is possible to have proofs of contextuality that do not use any incompatible measurements.

## Quantifying Nonlocality and Entanglement relative to Local Operations and Shared Randomness
### Jul 15, 2021

In order to develop a resource theory of nonlocality one must first isolate that essential physical property which underlies Bell inequality violation. We propose nonclassicality of a causal common cause as that property, which implies local operations and shared randomness (LOSR) as the choice of free operations. In this talk I'll explore a myriad after happy conceptual clarifications that follow from electing to quantify nonlocality via LOSR. Highlights include the resolution of anomalies between nonlocality and entanglement, a linear program formulation for assessing convertibility between nonsignalling boxes, conceptual cleanup regarding self-testing, and a causally-motivated definition of multipartiteness relative to LOSR. The latter connects this work to foundational quantum (and GPT) causal inference problems in the notorious triangle scenario.

Based primarily on the recently updated [Understanding the interplay of entanglement and nonlocality: motivating and developing a new branch of entanglement theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09194), as well as the new [No Bipartite-Nonlocal Causal Theory Can Explain Nature's Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09381), and [Quantifying Bell: the Resource Theory of Nonclassicality of Common-Cause Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06311).

## Quantum predictions arising from epistemically restricted classical predictions
### Jul 8, 2021

**Authors:** William F. Braasch Jr. and William K. Wootters  

**Abstract:** In a 2016 paper, Rob Spekkens presented an "epistemically restricted classical theory" based on discrete phase space.  The theory has many features in common with quantum theory, but it cannot imitate quantum theory perfectly because it is noncontextual.  

Here we start with a theory like the one Spekkens proposed, but we add a crucial ingredient in order to recover quantum theory itself for a certain class of systems.  The extra ingredient is to consider all the possible classical accounts of a given experiment, and to combine the predictions of these accounts by the following rule: the nonrandom part of the quantum prediction is given by the sum of the nonrandom parts of the classical predictions.

## Characterizing quantum systems with randomized measurements
### May 6, 2021

If only limited control over a multiparticle quantum system is available, a viable method to characterize correlations is to perform random measurements and consider the moments of the resulting probability distribution. We present ystematic ethods to analyze the different forms of entanglement with these moments in an optimized manner. First, we find the optimal criteria for different forms of multiparticle entanglement in three-qubit systems using the second moments of andomized measurements. Second, for higher-dimensional two-particle systems and higher moments, we provide criteria that are able to characterize various examples of bound entangled states, showing that detection of such states is possible in this framework. Finally, we analyze the resources needed for a statistically significant test

## Post-quantum non-classicality: the fun in dreaming
### April 15, 2021

Because "quantum" was not complex enough, in this talk I will introduce you to "post-quantum". We will discuss how current non-classical phenomena, such as those observed in Bell and Steering scenarios, have room to accommodate possible physical theories we have yet to grasp. I will also introduce you to mathematical frameworks to explore toy physical theories (which may supersede quantum) and manifestations of post-quantum phenomena. The aim is to provide you with sufficient context so you can pursue your desired journey into quantum foundations.

## Random Access Code Zoo
### March 25, 2021

Random Access Code (RAC) is a protocol in which some information is encoded into a system by sender and the receiver attempts to decode part of it. It so happens that quantum systems have an advantage over the classical in the terms of probability to decode the information correctly. In this talk I will present a whole zoo of different RAC variants. They have very different properties and applications ranging from practical information processing problems like quantum key distribution to foundations of physics to pure mathematics. I'll discuss these applications.

## Law without law: from observer states to physics via algorithmic information theory
### February 25, 2021

Physics and its philosophy are full of puzzles related to the
first-person perspective of observers: Wigner's friend, the Boltzmann
brain problem, Parfit's teletransportation paradox and many others. In
my talk, I argue that there are basically only two options: first,
deliberately declare those problems as outside the scope of science.
Second, explore an alternative approach to the foundations of physics in
which not an "external world", but a mathematical notion of "mind" is
primary. I show how such an approach can be rigorously formulated, how
it reproduces our usual picture of the world to excellent approximation,
and how it can solve the aforementioned problems and more in one stroke.

Based on [arXiv:1712.01826](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01826) / [Quantum 4, 301 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2020-07-20-301).
