## Characterizing quantum systems with randomized measurements
### May 6, 2021

If only limited control over a multiparticle quantum system is available, a viable method to characterize correlations is to perform random measurements and consider the moments of the resulting probability distribution. We present ystematic ethods to analyze the different forms of entanglement with these moments in an optimized manner. First, we find the optimal criteria for different forms of multiparticle entanglement in three-qubit systems using the second moments of andomized measurements. Second, for higher-dimensional two-particle systems and higher moments, we provide criteria that are able to characterize various examples of bound entangled states, showing that detection of such states is possible in this framework. Finally, we analyze the resources needed for a statistically significant test

## Post-quantum non-classicality: the fun in dreaming
### April 15, 2021

Because "quantum" was not complex enough, in this talk I will introduce you to "post-quantum". We will discuss how current non-classical phenomena, such as those observed in Bell and Steering scenarios, have room to accommodate possible physical theories we have yet to grasp. I will also introduce you to mathematical frameworks to explore toy physical theories (which may supersede quantum) and manifestations of post-quantum phenomena. The aim is to provide you with sufficient context so you can pursue your desired journey into quantum foundations.

## Random Access Code Zoo
### March 25, 2021

Random Access Code (RAC) is a protocol in which some information is encoded into a system by sender and the receiver attempts to decode part of it. It so happens that quantum systems have an advantage over the classical in the terms of probability to decode the information correctly. In this talk I will present a whole zoo of different RAC variants. They have very different properties and applications ranging from practical information processing problems like quantum key distribution to foundations of physics to pure mathematics. I'll discuss these applications.

## Law without law: from observer states to physics via algorithmic information theory
### February 25, 2021

Physics and its philosophy are full of puzzles related to the
first-person perspective of observers: Wigner's friend, the Boltzmann
brain problem, Parfit's teletransportation paradox and many others. In
my talk, I argue that there are basically only two options: first,
deliberately declare those problems as outside the scope of science.
Second, explore an alternative approach to the foundations of physics in
which not an "external world", but a mathematical notion of "mind" is
primary. I show how such an approach can be rigorously formulated, how
it reproduces our usual picture of the world to excellent approximation,
and how it can solve the aforementioned problems and more in one stroke.
