## Law without law: from observer states to physics via algorithmic information theory
### February 25, 2020

Physics and its philosophy are full of puzzles related to the
first-person perspective of observers: Wigner's friend, the Boltzmann
brain problem, Parfit's teletransportation paradox and many others. In
my talk, I argue that there are basically only two options: first,
deliberately declare those problems as outside the scope of science.
Second, explore an alternative approach to the foundations of physics in
which not an "external world", but a mathematical notion of "mind" is
primary. I show how such an approach can be rigorously formulated, how
it reproduces our usual picture of the world to excellent approximation,
and how it can solve the aforementioned problems and more in one stroke.
