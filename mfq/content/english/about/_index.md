  title: "About Us"
  content: "We are a research group on foundations of quantum theory spread between the [Mathematics Institute](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/en) and the [Physics Institute](https://portal.ifi.unicamp.br/en/) at [University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english), one of the top Brazilian universities. Our group leaders are [Marcelo Terra Cunha](/~mfq/people/terra) and [Rafael Rabelo](/~mfq//people/rabelo), and our students are spread between the Mathematics and the Physics undergraduate and graduate programs. Some of our interests are [contextuality](/~mfq/research/contextuality), [generalized probabilistic theories](/~mfq/research/gpts), [non-locality](/~mfq/research/nonlocality) and [other correlation scenarios](/~mfq/research/correlations), and quantum foundations/information in general. You can learn more about us by reading this page, but also feel invited to drop us an email in case you want to talk."
