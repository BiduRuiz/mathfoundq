Our interests involve, but are not limited to, contextuality, generalized probabilistic theories, non-locality and other correlation scenarios. If you are interested in working with us, don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:MathFoundQ@unicamp.br)."

      title : "Non-locality"
      content : "Non-locality is the presence of strong correlations between spatially separated parts of a system — so strong that they can are not allowed by classical theories. Surprisingly, they are possible in quantum systems, thus putting a clear divide between the classical and quantum worlds. Our group is interested in all theoretical aspects of non-locality, and particularly in understanding how and when it can be observed."

      title : "Contextuality"
      content : "Imagine nonlocality without the need for parts. This is contextuality, the most surprising treat of quantum theory. It appears when probabilistic descriptions of subcollections of variables can not be extended to a consistent probabilistic description of the full collection."

      title : "GPTs"
      content : "Can nature be even more weird than quantum? If so, what physical principles underlie such weirdness? The Generalized Probabilistic Theories framework provides an unified description of quantum, classical and many other theories, allowing to tackle those and other exciting questions, while  providing alternative ways to understand quantum theory itself."

    #   title : "Correlation scenarios"
    #   content : "Correlation scenarios model the influences that some events may have upon others — like the choice of a measurement influencing its possible results, or an unknown source of correlations linking apparently independent events. They are an important doorway to learn when, why, and up to where quantum resources may outperform classical ones in informational tasks."
